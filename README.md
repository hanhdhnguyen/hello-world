# hello-world
I am learning to code so let's see how much I will progress over time. Coming from a non-technical background makes my journey very interesting because I do enjoy everything I have learnt so far. We will see what I would do to this repository
I know that I should write something about myself and try different markdown elements. But I honestly don't understand the function of a markdown. Hopefully my question is answered as I learn more about Github
